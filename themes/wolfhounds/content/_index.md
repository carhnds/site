    text:
      If you're new to the sport of rugby, it's unlike any other sport. On the field everyone is competitive, but afterwards we treat each other with dignity and respect. It's one of the most pleasant youth sporting activities you can find.

    text:
      Every one of our coaches is passionate about keeping players healthy. Rugby is a contact sport with a lot of bumps and bruises, but we see far fewer major injuries than a typical football team. We have a certified EMT/Sports Medicine Trainer at every match and our coaches must attain the SafeSport certification prior to participating in any team activities.
